Hello! I am Stefanos, now in the third year of my PhD journey in Decision Sciences at INSEAD, guided by my advisors Georgina Hall and Spyros Zoumpoulis, and collaborating closely with Hamsa Bastani.

My research interests span experimentation, policy optimization, transfer and multi-task learning, and AI-assisted decision-making.  I am particularly interested in understanding and developing the data-generation processes necessary for crafting more effective policies. Additionally, I study how we should design and provide AI and algorithmic advice or tips to people, aiming to improve human decision-making.

Before turning to research, I ventured into entrepreneurship for which I was recognized in the Forbes 30under30 list for Greece. I have also contributed to womenâ€™s economic development through my roles in public policy & government affairs, and education at MExoxo.

I received a B.S. and M.Eng. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the National Technical University of Athens. My full CV is available [here](/files/Stefanos_Poulidis_CV.pdf).
