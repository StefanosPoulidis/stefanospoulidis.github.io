Hi! I am Stefanos, now in the third year of my PhD journey in Decision Sciences at INSEAD. I am incredibly grateful for the continuous mentoring from Hamsa Bastani and my advisor Spyros Zoumpoulis.

My research interests span experimentation, policy learning, algorithmic advice, and human-centered AI. I focus on developing data-generation processes to formulate more effective policies. Additionally, I study AI-assisted decision-making, emphasizing on algorithmic advice that augments human capabilities without negative externalities, such as impeding human learning.

Before turning to research, I ventured into entrepreneurship, for which I was recognized in the Forbes 30under30 list for Greece. I have also contributed to womenâ€™s economic development through my public policy and education roles at MExoxo.

I received a B.S. and M.Eng. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the National Technical University of Athens. My full CV is available [here](/files/Stefanos_Poulidis_CV.pdf).
