I am Stefanos Poulidis, a PhD student in Decision Sciences at INSEAD, advised by Georgina Hall and Spyros Zoumpoulis.

I’m interested in experimentation, policy optimization, transfer and multi-task learning, and AI-assisted decision-making. Specifically, I am interested in data generation processes and data-driven optimization to learn more profitable policies. Additionally, I look into challenges relating to how we should design AI tips in healthcare, marketing, and revenue management settings to improve human decision-making.

Previously, I spent two years as an entrepreneur, co-founding Soccerhub, and helping women’s economic development by serving as the director of public policy & government affairs, and later as the director of education & entrepreneurship at MExoxo. 

I received a B.S. and M.Eng. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the National Technical University of Athens. You can find my full CV [here](/files/Stefanos_Poulidis_CV.pdf).
