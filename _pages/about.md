I am a third-year PhD candidate in Decision Sciences at INSEAD. I am immensely fortunate to be mentored and advised by Professors Hamsa Bastani and Spyros Zoumpoulis.

My research interests center on experimentation, policy learning, algorithmic advice, and human-centered AI. I am particularly engaged in developing data-generation processes and novel algorithms to learn more effective policies. Additionally, I explore AI-assisted decision-making, with a special emphasis on algorithmic advice that enhances human capabilities without hindering human learning.

Before turning to research, I ventured into entrepreneurship, for which I was recognized in the Forbes 30under30 list for Greece. I have also contributed to womenâ€™s economic development through my public policy and education roles at MExoxo.

I received a B.S. and M.Eng. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the National Technical University of Athens. My full CV is available [here](/files/Stefanos_Poulidis_CV.pdf).
