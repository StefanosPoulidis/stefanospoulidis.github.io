I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Decision Sciences at INSEAD. I am immensely fortunate to be mentored and advised by Professors [Hamsa Bastani](https://hamsabastani.github.io/index.html) and [Spyros Zoumpoulis](https://www.insead.edu/faculty-personal-site/spyros-zoumpoulis/research).

My research explores how humans and AI work together, with a particular focus on how algorithmic advice influences human learning, decision-making, and performance.

Before my academic pursuits, I embarked on an entrepreneurial journey, earning recognition on the [Forbes 30 Under 30](https://www.forbesgreece.gr/forbes-30-under-30-2021/3497509/stefanos-stib-poulidis-o-24xronos-pou-xtizei-podosfairikes-omades-kai-fernei-nea-pnoi-sta-logistics) list for Greece. I also contributed to womenâ€™s economic development through my public policy and education roles at [MExoxo](https://www.mexoxo.com/).

I received a B.S. and M.Eng. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the National Technical University of Athens. My full CV is available [here](Stefanos_Poulidis_CV.pdf).
