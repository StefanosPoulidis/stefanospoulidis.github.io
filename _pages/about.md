Hi! I am Stefanos, now in the third year of my PhD journey in Decision Sciences at INSEAD. I am incredibly grateful for the guidance of my advisors, Georgina Hall and Spyros Zoumpoulis, as well as for the continuous mentoring from Hamsa Bastani.

My research interests span experimentation, policy optimization, transfer and multi-task learning, and algorithmic advice.  I am particularly interested in understanding and developing the data-generation processes necessary for crafting more effective policies. Additionally, I study AI-assisted decision-making and how we should design and provide algorithmic advice to people, aiming to improve human decision-making.

Before turning to research, I ventured into entrepreneurship, for which I was recognized in the Forbes 30under30 list for Greece. I have also contributed to womenâ€™s economic development through my public policy and education roles at MExoxo.

I received a B.S. and M.Eng. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the National Technical University of Athens. My full CV is available [here](/files/Stefanos_Poulidis_CV.pdf).
