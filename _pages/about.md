I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Decision Sciences at INSEAD. I am immensely fortunate to be mentored and advised by [Hamsa Bastani](https://hamsabastani.github.io/index.html) and [Spyros Zoumpoulis](https://www.insead.edu/faculty-personal-site/spyros-zoumpoulis/research).

My research explores human-AI collaboration; specifically, I focus on how algorithmic advice influences human learning, decision-making, and performance.

Before my academic pursuits, I embarked on an entrepreneurial journey, earning recognition on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list for Greece. I also contributed to womenâ€™s economic development through my public policy and education roles at MExoxo.

I received a B.S. and M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens. My full CV is available [here](Stefanos_Poulidis_CV.pdf).

**Research interests**

behavioral & data-driven operations management, human-AI collaboration, policy learning, service operations
