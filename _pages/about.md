I am Stefanos Poulidis, a PhD student in Decision Sciences at INSEAD. Iâ€™m interested in experimentation, data-driven optimization, and machine learning interventions.  Specifically, I look into challenges relating to policy optimization, personalized policies, and AI tips in healthcare, marketing and revenue management settings.

Previously, I spent two years as an entrepreneur, co-founding Soccerhub and Boxbeat. I received a B.S. and M.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at National Technical University of Athens. You can find my full CV here.
