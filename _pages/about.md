I am Stefanos Poulidis, a PhD student at Decision Sciences at INSEAD. Iâ€™m interested in experimentation, data-driven optimization, and machine learning interventions.  Specifically, I look into challenges relating to policy optimization, personalized policies, and AI tips.

Previously, I spent two years as a data scientist at Uber, working on match optimization for UberPOOL. I recieved a B.S. in Industrial Engineering and an M.S. in Computer Science at Northwestern. You can find my full CV here.
