I am a third-year PhD candidate in Decision Sciences at INSEAD. I am immensely fortunate to be mentored and advised by Professors Hamsa Bastani and Spyros Zoumpoulis.

My research centers on experimentation, policy learning, algorithmic advice, and human-centered AI. My work so far focuses on developing data-generation processes and novel algorithms to learn more effective policies, particularly accounting for human-AI interactions. I explore AI-assisted decision-making, with an emphasis on algorithmic advice that enhances human capabilities without hindering human learning.

Prior to my academic pursuits, I embarked on an entrepreneurial journey, earning recognition on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list for Greece and contributing to womenâ€™s economic development through my public policy and education roles at MExoxo, an NPO supported by the Clinton Foundation.

I received a B.S. and M.Eng. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the National Technical University of Athens. My full CV is available [here](/files/Stefanos_Poulidis_CV.pdf).
